# Data-Science-Competition-2021
2nd place at the Texas A&amp;M University Data Science Competition 2021. Included here are the notebooks, report, and presentation. 
The code includes all processing of data and figure generation for analysis. 

The competition was an open-problem statement related to the US Elections. My prime focus was to predict fundraising in different states, given the voter demographics. This analysis had several challenges including combining data from multiple files, mapping IDs to candidates to parties and relevant PACs. The model was built at a state level and thus not a lot of data was available (4 year election cycle and relevant data availability since 2000)
